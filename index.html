            <h2>Joshua's Remarks</h2>
            <p>Inyene... In the end you turn out to be the little brother never had. So this is the day you finally become 13 years.<br>
            Meaning you have a greater responsibility than before, you have a lot of things to lern about life, and the only way you can<br>
            learn it is through gradual experience an believe me there's a lot to learn. You must learn that not everythng must go your way.<br>
            In must countries you are considered an adult and allowed to live your life the way you want, but by the grace of God you didn't<br>
            end up in those places. You will learn that you have to alk away from some things that may hold you back. You must lean to accept<br>
            some things that might discomfort you, and I can say it again that you must accept many difficultes as lessons and you must learn from them.<br>
            Life isn't a bed of roses, rathr it is a bed that you must lay everday.</p>
            <p>God always has a plan for everyone, that's why your first son. You have a level of responsiblity that I can't push my hands towards<br>
            so if my life turns out easy don't expect yours to be easy to.Don't for once think that you're a failur cause you are above failure.<br>
            You have a great future and I pray God will make it greater and more prosperous as He has destined it. You are celebrating your birthday in the<br>
            month of Conglutination. God be with you dear. But always remember that I wil always be taller than you. Haaaaa! Greet the family for me, Happy Buffday!!!!</p>
